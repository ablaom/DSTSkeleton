# New to both Julia and machine learning?

To get started with Julia, you can try one of the external resources
at the top of [this page](new_to_julia.md). 

Once you have basic Julia competency, try the [Introduction to
Statistical Learning](/categories/intro_to_stats_.earning.md)
tutorials or one of these [external reources](/external_resources.md):

- [Julia Data
  Science](https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience): Book
  focused on exploratory data analysis with less on ML.

- [MLCourse](https://github.com/jbrea/MLCourse): Teaching material for
  an introductory machine learning course at EPFL (for an interactive
  preview see [here](https://bio322.epfl.ch)).
