# New to machine learning but have moderate Julia skills?

Start out with the [Introduction to Statistical
Learning](/categories/intro_to_stats_learning.md) tutorials, or one of
these [external resources](/external_resources.md):

- [MLCourse](https://github.com/jbrea/MLCourse): Teaching material for
  an introductory machine learning course at EPFL (for an interactive
  preview see [here](https://bio322.epfl.ch)).

- [Julia Data
  Science](https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience): Book
  focused on exploratory data analysis with less on ML.
